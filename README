# Grade Management System

This program is a Grade Management System implemented in Java. It interacts with a MySQL database to store and manage information about classes, students, assignments, and grades. The program provides a command-line interface that allows users to create new classes, add students, add assignments, grade assignments, and view grades. The main function of the program establishes a connection to the database and sets up the database schema. The program also provides an option to load sample data into the database. The command loop allows the user to enter commands to interact with the program, and each command is implemented as a separate function. The program uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with the MySQL database, and all database interactions are encapsulated within the program's functions.
